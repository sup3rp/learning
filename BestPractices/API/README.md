## What is an API?
<p align="center">API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of engineering standards, rules and tools that allows different software applications to be buil to communicate with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information. They provide a way for developers to access the functionality of a software component or service without having to understand its internal workings.</p>
<p>As a webdeveloper I'll focus more on APIs designed for web apps, since that is the main type I work with. Let's us focus on creating a guideline that we can follow whenever we need to create an API.</p>

## Different types of APIs

APIs can be categorized into different types, including:
<ol>
    <li><b>Web APIs (or HTTP APIs):</b> These APIs enable communication over the web using standard protocols such as HTTP. REST (Representational State Transfer) and GraphQL are common styles of web APIs.</li>
    <li><b>Library APIs:</b> These APIs provide a set of functions or procedures that can be called by a program, allowing developers to use pre-built functionality without having to write the code from scratch.</li>
    <li><b>Operating System APIs: </b>These APIs provide a way for software applications to interact with the underlying operating system, accessing resources such as files, memory, and hardware devices.</li>
  </ol>

## Different types of Web APIs
There are various types of web APIs, each with its own characteristics and use cases. The main types of web APIs are RESTful APIs, RPC, SOAP, WebSocket and GraphQL APIs.

### What is REST?
<p>RESTful APIs (Representational State Transfer) - The most used type of Web API, uses HTTP and it allows web apps to communicate in a client - server approach, where the server provides the client with the API. This type of API was first intented to be stateless, meaning the server does not save the state of the client, and also is very open to interpretation, which allows a great level of freedom but also a lot of opportunities to design an inconsistent/bad API.</p>
<p>Analysis:</p>
<ol>
   <li><b> Architecture Style - </b> REST is an architectural style that follows a set of constraints and principles, such as statelessness and uniform interface.</li>
   <li><b> Communication - </b> RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication. Each resource is identified by a unique URL.</li>
   <li><b> Data Format - </b> Commonly use JSON as the data format, but XML is also supported.</li>
   <li><b> Statelessness - </b> Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and fulfill the request. The server does not store the client's state between requests.</li>
</ol>
<p>Standards/Best practices:</p>
<ol>
   <li><b>Use nouns, not verbs - </b> The core idea to retain here is that nouns must be used and verbs must be avoided in the endpoint paths, because they already exist in the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). Instead, the pathname should only contain the target of the request, so use nouns that identify the resource that we want to target. For example, instead of using <i>GET: /getAllClients</i> to fetch all clients, use  <i>GET: /clients</i>.</li>
   <li><b>Use plural resource nouns - </b>Use the plural form for resource nouns because this fits all types of endpoints. For example, instead of using <i>/employee/:id/</i>, use <i>/employees/:id/</i>.</li>
   <li><b>Consistency is key - </b> Created a robust, predictable and consistent API that clients can use. This will allow client side development to be more quick and less error prune.</li>
   <li><b>Resource oriented - </b>Endpoints should be resource-oriented. For example, if you want to design an API for users: <i>/users</i> will return all users, <i>/users/124</i> will return the resource 124 from users</li>, <i>/users/124?page=1&page_size=10</i> will return the resource 124 from users with pagination, requesting page 1 with an offset of 10.
   <li><b>Nesting resources - </b> When designing an API, it might make sense to group those that contain associated information. If one object can contain another object, we should design an API that reflect that. This is a good practice even if (and specially because) it does not mirror your database tables/relationships (which honestly just makes the job easier to hackers) and allows the clients to easily retrive/create/change related resources. For example, <i>/api/v1/posts/124/comments</i>.</li>
   <li><b>Make use of HTTP Status Codes - </b> This is one is really important. We should always return HTTP status codes as this is an industry standard. This is even more important if we are designing an API to be used by clients that we don't develop. The status codes should be used for the same outcomes across the API:
    <ol>
      <li>200 for general success.</li>
      <li>201 for successful creation.</li>
      <li>202 for a successful request.</li>
      <li>204 for no content.</li>
      <li>307 for redirected content.</li>
      <li>400 for bad requests.</li>
      <li>401 for unauthorized requests.</li>
      <li>403 for missing permissions.</li>
      <li>404 for lacking resources.</li>
      <li>500 for internal errors.</li>
      <li>501 for not implemented.</li>
      <li>502 for bad gateway.</li>
      <li>503 for service unavailable.</li>
      <li>504 for gateway timeout.</li>
    </ol>
   </li>
   <li><b>Return JSON, not plain text! - </b> REST APIs should accept and return JSON as this is the standard in the industry. JSON is a type of data structure that will aid clients and servers processing requests.</li>
   <li><b>Handle errors - </b> Return codes between 400 and 5xx and return details in the response body along with the status code.</li>
   
   <li><b>Service evolution - </b> A well-design API should evolve independently of its clients, this allows it to rollout new features without introducing breaking changes that might affect clients. In order to do this we must introduce versioning, backward compatibility and discoverability (allow clients to discover new endpoints through resource linking and documentation) </li>
   <li><b>Incorporate filtering, sortign and pagination - </b> Design for the future, include filtering, sorting and pagination whenever you need to return a set of items. Use <i>sort=X:asc</i> or <i>sort=X:desc</i>, <i>page=x</i> and <i>page_size=x</i> in the url arguments. For example, <i>/api/v1/posts/124/comments?page=1&page_size=10&sort=createdAt:desc&country=PT</i>.</li>
   <li><b>Versioning - </b> Design for the future, predicting that the API must be retrocompatible sometime in the future, design from day 1 an API that can allow versioning. Remember that y For example <i>api/v1/products/124</i>.</li>
   <li><b>Caching - </b> Consider caching some of the results that don't change to often in order to boost performance and scalability.</li>
   <li><b>Security - </b> Use SSL/TLS, API keys.</li>
   <li><b>Rate limiting - </b> In order to prevent abuse or a infine loop bug from the clients that migh trigger a huge amount of requests it is a standard practice to implement rate limiting in an API, commonly signaled by the HTTP status code 429 Too Many Requests.</li>
   <li><b>Documentation - </b> Use proper standards like OpenAPI definition, use tools like Swagger, Postman and Stoplight.</li>
